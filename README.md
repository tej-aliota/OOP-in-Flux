# OOP-in-Flux

1. Multiple different types of objects in fluxx, this includes goal, action, keeper, and new rule cards.
2. Each of these different cards has a different attribute that tells you to do something new.
3. The Goal cards contain the attribute of a goal which changes how the game is allowed to end.
4. The Action cards contain the attribute of actions which mean they are different moves and plays that a player is allowed to perform.
5. The Keeper cards contain an attribute of an object or number that helps you win. If you have keeper cards with the correct
attributes than you can win!!
7. The New Rule cards contain the attribute of allowing for added or lost rules that make the game more interesting.
8. All these cards combined help to make the game a really complex card game with different twists and turns.
9. The final oop thing I see is the players which best represent coders who are able to create different objects and determain their attibutes, and how they affect the game.
